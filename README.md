# 12to24
12to24 is a Chrome/Firefox browser extension that converts times in a 12 hour format to a 24 hour one on any webpage.

## Issues

As I can't possibly think of every single edge case, some times might not be detected by the extension. If this is the case, please open up an [issue](https://github.com/NicolasNewman/12to24/issues) and include the following:
1) The time that wasn't converted
2) The HTML tag that the time was in (if you know how to find it)

If you find any other bugs with the extension or would like to request a feature, please open up an [issue](https://github.com/NicolasNewman/12to24/issues)
